🌆 City Worth Living Predictor (KNN)

This project uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict whether an Indian city is worth living or not based on important urban factors such as:

🌫 Air Quality Index (AQI)

🚔 Crime Rate

🏥 Healthcare Index

🎓 Education Index

💼 Job Opportunities

🔍 Why KNN?

KNN is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies new data points based on their similarity to existing labeled data.
In this project, KNN helps determine if a city is "Worth Living" by comparing its parameters with other cities.
